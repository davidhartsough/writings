HapiDaily: have a positive impact daily.

Since 2015, HapiDaily has been a mission to empower people with ideas on how to make a difference in the lives of others through everyday expressions of love. Every year I revised the project to get to the heart of what love looks like in daily interactions.

From 2015â€“2018, I used to send out a daily text message to anyone who subscribed to them that provided them with a practical and universal way to show love (and grow). Then in 2019 I created a [web app](https://app.hapidaily.com/) and [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidhartsough.hapidaily) that let you pick out or create your own dailies and set goals to have positive impacts on the people in your life.

Here are the lists compiled each year that outline effective and universal ways to give others recognition, appreciation, affirmation, admiration, attention, support, praise, and encouragement.

- [2020](#2020)
- [2019](#hapidaily-2019)
- [2018](#hapidaily-2018)
- [2017](#hapidaily-2017)
- [2015](#hapidaily-2015)

## 2020

Technically this isn't associated with the HapiDaily project. But, in a sense, it is my latest takeaways from everything I learned while making HapiDaily. See my latest reflections on this: [What is love?](https://davidhartsough.com/writings/what-is-love)
