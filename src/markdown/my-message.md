## Preface

Back in 2015 I was rather obsessed with condensing all the important life lessons into simple, codified, conclusive statements. I tried to identify which core truths were at the root of all essential wisdom. I tried narrowing down my large list of "statements that somewhat summarize my ideals" into a cohesive message that would be my main motto: "My Message".

Unsurprisingly, this is strikingly similar to the motivational message I had written five years prior: [A Short Life On A Small Planet](https://davidhartsough.com/writings/short-life-small-planet).

If approached/handled correctly, our greatest sufferings/hardships can be the most useful, meaningful, influential and beneficial experience in life. They each have the potential to teach us and give us newfound wisdom. Through them we can develop our inner strength, peace and will. We can seize each trial as a tool to forge meaning and build identity.

Acknowledge, recognize, process, reflect, evaluate, analyze, understand, accept, release, let go, cultivate, cease

Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs

**Perspective shapes reality.**

What is your perspective on this world? What is your perspective on this life?

I invite you now to come and see the world in a new way. Take on a new perspective. Take on a new reality.

Start with the big picture:

Everything that we can observe, exists in the universe. Using the current technology on Earth, humans can observe 46.5 billion light-years in every direction into space. So far, humans have found that Earth is one planet of eight in a solar system of many billion in a galaxy of 80 billion in their observable sphere of the universe.

On Earth there are 7 billion humans. You make up 0.0000000145% of the Earth's population. The current life expectancy for humans in "well-developed" countries is about 75 years of age. In these countries, the average individuals mature around the age of 15 and sleeps an approximate average of 8 hours per day. This leaves one with only 350,400 hours mature, awake and alive. Life is short.

Experience is the best teacher (and suffering even better stillâ€¦ [below])

If approached/handled correctly, our greatest **sufferings/hardships** can be the most useful, meaningful, influential and beneficial experience in life. They each have the potential to **teach us** and give us newfound wisdom. Through them we can **develop our inner strength, peace and will**. We can seize each trial as a tool to **forge meaning** and **build identity**.

Throughout all experiences one must **be mindful and aware**, leaving one's self ample time to process, reflect, **examine**, analyze, understand, and recognize all thoughts, actions, reasons, feelings, ideas, and values. Then one should come in **open honesty** to **accept and acknowledge** these things for what they are, **cultivating** the thoughts, actions, feelings, ideas, and values that are positive and reasonable, while **releasing** and letting go of those that are not.

When one learns to **love and accept the self**, one will be able to truly **give and receive love and acceptance** in consequence.

The most important and meaningful things in life are other people and your relationships, connections and interactions with them.
