## Update (Nov, 2019)

A months after I wrote the original draft ([see previous version below](#previous-version-sept-2019)), I wasn't fully satisfied with my previous outline of my ideal impact (which tends to happen more commonly than I thought). As life goes on, I learn more about myself and my potential, which inevitably changes my ideals, so even this latest revision may feel outdated in the months that follow. Time will tell!

## Ultimate goal and impact

### Fostering Flourishing

Help humanity **define, outline, and operationalize flourishing** ("the good life")
... from the universal level to the personal level.

Create a framework for fostering flourishing.

- Create educational resources that provide explanatory knowledge of this framework.
- Create practical tools that apply this framework to prioritization, goal setting, and decision making.
- Create promotional media that advocates the adoption, implementation, integration, and utilization of this framework.
- (All creations and content are based on scientific research.)

#### Thanks

[ClearerThinking.org](https://www.clearerthinking.org/) and its [Lifetime Aspirations](http://programs.clearerthinking.org/life_assessment.html) program helped me form this conclusive "ultimate goal".
