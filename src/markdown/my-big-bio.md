## Preface

I believe this was written in January, 2017. Back then I had a website running called My Big Bio (at www.mybig.bio). You could create an autobiography with it by simply answering a series of questions grouped by sections. The following are my answers to the questions from the Perspective and Purpose sections of my autobiography.
