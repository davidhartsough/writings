## TL;DR:

Overall Conclusions / Key Takeaways / Main Principles

### The Big Problem / Question

How do we make _good decisions_ that lead to _good futures_ that we'll be **happy** with?

### Don't's (What not to do)

Don't rely on our brain's systems for _imagination_, simulation, foresight, and prediction.

Don't rely on our brain's systems for _retrospection_, reflection, hindsight, and memory.

Don't rely on our brain's systems to think about _the future_ or _the past_.

(Also: Don't rely on the bad advice of others that comes from _super-replicating beliefs_.)

### Do's (What to do instead)

Use other people's current emotional experiences to inform decisions.

(Find others who are experiencing what you think might be your next "best future" and ask them what it's like and if they're happy.)

## [From (mostly) the Foreword and Chapter 1]

### What is this book about?

> "[…] this is a book that describes what science has to tell us about **how and how well the human brain can imagine its own future**, and about **how and how well it can predict which of those futures it will most enjoy**." — (Foreword, p. 15)

### Context: Wanting is Expecting

To _want_ something is to _expect_ that: if you _get_ it, then _your future self_ will be _happy_ with it.

We assume that we can just make accurate expectations based on our predictions about what our future selves will be happy with.

#### Problem: Wrong Expectations

Often we are _wrong_ about our expectations on what our futures selves will be happy with. <br>
We mistakenly think we're good at predicting what our future selves will be happy with.

How can we accurately predict what our future selves will be happy with?

### Context: The Best Future

We want to make decisions and make _good_ decisions. <br>
Each decision leads to a _future_, and some futures are better than others. <br>
The best decision should lead to the best future.

We want to predict: which _decision_ will lead to which _future_ and which future is _best_. <br>
We tend to think we know: which future is best and which decision will lead to that future.

But the truth is that: the future is fundamentally _different_ than it seems from our predictions and imaginations.

So how can we accurately predict which future is best?

#### Problem: Illusions of Foresight

Just as we experience illusions of _hindsight_, so too do we experience illusions of _foresight_.

_Imagination_ is our tool to look forward into time (foresight).

Sometimes our imaginations lead us to foresee things as they will _not_ be.

## [From (mostly) Chapter 11 and Afterword]

### Context: Our Happiness is in Our Hands

There are many key parts of our life that impact our happiness, including where we live, what we do, and who we do it with.

Only a few generations ago in recent history, we have entered a new paradigm where we get to _choose_ these key parts of our lives, and so we are responsible for: making important decisions that impact our happiness.

We have several important decisions in life that impact our happiness. <br>
(Ex: "where to live", "what to do", and "who to do it with". AKA: pick a city, pick a career, pick hobbies, pick friends, and pick a partner.)

Recent revolutions in civilization resulted in an explosion of personal liberty, granting us each a bewildering array of options, alternatives, choices, and decisions that our ancestors never faced. For the very first time, our happiness is in our hands.

**Our Goal**: We want to be happy, so we want to make good decisions. <br>
**Our Problem**: We're not too great at this. <br>
(Ex: "The average American moves more than 6 times, changes jobs more than 10 times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices.")

**Our Question**: How should we make our decisions? <br>
Of all the possible lives we can pick from, how do we choose a life that we will ultimately be happy with?

Perhaps we have 2 options:

1.  **Imagination**: Use our imagination to simulate possible futures.
2.  **Surrogation**: Ask others about their current experiences.

### Our Default Choice: Imagination / Simulation

Typically, we try to: _imagine / simulate_ future selves, circumstances, and experiences.

When left to our own devices, we tend to just try utilizing the tool of _imagination_ to simulate possible _future selves_ and pick the best choice (the best simulation).

(Our brain's imagination capabilities allow us to _simulate_ future selves and future circumstances, and in these simulations we try to _evaluate_ and compare those imagined experiences.)

#### Sadly, Our Imagination is Flawed

We're bad at imagination; our ability to imagine future selves is _not_ fine-tuned.

**Problem: Inaccuracy**

When we imagine future circumstances, we _fill in_ details that won't really come to pass and _leave out_ details that will.

**Problem: Presentism**

When we imagine future feelings, we find it impossible to ignore what we are feeling _now_ and impossible to recognize how we will think about the things that happen _later_.

#### Conclusion: Don't Use Imagination

We shouldn't rely on our emotional future simulation abilities to make decisions.

### The Neglected Choice: "Surrogation" (Asking Others)

Instead of trying to _imagine_ everything, we could just _ask others_ about everything.

(We have an endless pile of information about everything and what it feels like to do anything and make any decision.)

> "[…] the best way to predict our feelings tomorrow is to see how others are feeling today." — (Ch 11, p 236)

How should we inquire about other people's experiences?

Perhaps we have two ways of approaching this:

1.  Ask them about their _past_ experiences.
2.  Ask them about their current, _present_ experiences.

#### The Past (Reflection / Memory)

We could ask people to tell us about their _past_ experiences.

**Problem**: Memory is flawed, so we should not rely on testimony.

**Conclusion**: Don't use anyone's retrospection, reflection, or memory (including your own).

#### The Present (Introspection)

We could ask people to tell us about their current experiences.

Because both _imagination_ (simulating future experiences) and _memory_ (remembering past experiences) are _flawed_, we should not rely on them to make decisions.

Instead we should try to ask other people to introspect on their _current_ inner states.

And yet, even this still has problems:

1.  A lot of the advice from others is _bad_ (and just systemically perpetuated).
2.  We _reject_ the good advice of others.

#### Problem 1: Accepting Bad Advice

Inaccurate _super-replicating_ beliefs tend to fuel the needs of the social systems yet also mislead people.

Often, bad advice comes from super-replicating beliefs that _aren't_ good for the _individual_ but are great at cyclical transmission and usually _necessary_ for the larger _social systems_.

#### Problem 2: Rejecting Good Advice

The _fingerprint fallacy_ leads us to believe that we are each unique, different, and special.

> "[…] the experience of a single randomly selected individual can sometimes provide a better basis for predicting your future experience than your own imagination can." — (Ch 11, p 232)

And yet… We find this difficult to believe. Why? Because we believe we're different, unique, and special.

- Most people don't know they're like most people.
- The average person doesn't see herself as _average_.
- We tend to think of ourselves as _different_ from others.
- We almost always see ourselves as _unique_.
- The self considers itself to be a very _special_ person.

Why do we believe we're different, not average, unique, and special?

1. We learn about ourselves in a special, unique way (unlike how we learn about anyone or anything else).
2. We _enjoy_ thinking of ourselves as special. (And thus we overestimate it.)
   - We prize our unique identities.
   - We strive to distance and _distinguish_ ourselves.
   - We love _individuality_.
   - We value our uniqueness.
3. We tend to overestimate everyone's uniqueness.
   - We think of people as more _different_ from one another than they actually are.
   - We think people are more varied than they actually are.
   - We overestimate the magnitude and frequency of people's differences.
   - We spend much of our time searching for, attending to, thinking about, and remembering people's differences.

We tend to refuse to believe other people's experiences and feelings are _legitimate_ and _useful_ approximations and predictions. We think other people are _too different_ from us and thus deny their emotional experiences as being _similar enough_ to what our own would be. (Why? Because we wrongly believe in the _variability_ and _uniqueness_ of individuals.)

> "Alas, we think of ourselves as unique entities — minds unlike any others — and thus **we often reject the lessons that the emotional experience of others has to teach us**." — (Ch 11, p 241)

### (In) The End

> "[…] surrogation is a cheap and effective way to predict one's future emotions, but because we don't realize just how similar we all are, we reject this reliable method and rely instead on our imaginations, as flawed and fallible as they may be." — (Ch 11, p 240)

We use our flawed and fallible imaginations instead of this reliable, cheap, and effective method of predicting future emotions because we don't realize just how similar we all are.
