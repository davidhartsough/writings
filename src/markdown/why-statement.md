## Preface

The idea of the "why statement" comes from Simon Sinek's book _Start With Why_. In it he says, "The WHY is the purpose, cause or belief that drives every one of us." The statement is written in the form of two parts: your contribution and your impact. Typically this is written as "To [contribute] so that [impact]." This document was the scratch pad of ideas that helped me write my first WHY statement in 2017.

There's very little meaning to the universe holistically, so, when it comes to your life, you'll have to forge your own.

To foster flourishing by building communities that cultivate curiosity and advocate education

The drive to thrive and strive for the best.

Education - curiosity, conversation, collaboration, creation

To cultivate communities, connections, and collaborations focused on the examination, exploration, and education of flourishing so that humanity would define its purpose in thriving and striving for the best.

To help humanity understand and achieve flourishing through connection, education, examination, and actualization.

Flourishing through self-actualization, self-examination, and human connection

To build deep connections, a firm identity, and a life of purpose. To evaluate what is most meaningful and important. To achieve self-actualization. To be confident and calm. To share laughter and love. And to help, encourage, motivate and inspire others to do likewise.

To help humanity understand and achieve flourishing.

I am a happy human who loves people and ideas, asking questions, and sharing laughter. I am passionate about helping people build connections, discover their potential, explore new perspectives and experiences, and achieve self-actualization. Other things I can't live without: music, psychology, philosophy, and parkour.

I want to help humanity understand and achieve flourishing (actualization; transcendence; ikigai; fulfillment), and I believe this can be achieved through a focus on community, ideas, values, lifelong education, and purposeful projects.

Helping humanity understand and achieve flourishing. Cultivating community, connection, and collaboration. Advocating lifelong education. Studying psychology and philosophy. Asking questions. Learning about others. Teaching emotional intelligence, self-transcendence, ikigai, and flourishing. Creating music. Sharing laughter and playfulness.
