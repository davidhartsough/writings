Just do it. Do whatever you want to.

**Love, respect, and care about others.**

## Small Planet

Earth is one planet of eight in our one solar system of many billion in our one galaxy of eighty billion in the universe. Standing, you take up one square foot. You are 0.0000036% of one square mile, 0.00000000000095% of the USA’s 3,794,101 square miles, and 0.0000000000000114% of the 316,944,047 square miles on the Earth’s surface. One light-year is 5,878,630,000,000 miles. Our solar system spans approximately 2 light-years, leaving you as 0.000000000000000000000000000000033% (3.3e-32%) of the solar system's two-dimensional span. The Milky Way is our large disk-like galaxy that spans 2.7142018e35 square miles. You take up 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000133% (1.33e-41%) of the Milky Way galaxy.

## Many People

You are one person of 7,600,000,000 on this planet. You are 0.000000013% of earth’s population, and 0.0000003% of the population in the USA, totaling 325,700,000 citizens.

(**Note**: These numbers were last updated May, 2018.)

## Short Life

The average person lives around 80 years, matures at the age of 15, and winds down at 70 which leaves you with 55 years or 20,075 days or 481,800 hours of life in your prime. Meanwhile, you will spend 221,500 hours at high school, at work, sleeping, and in traffic, leaving you with only **260,300 hours** to truly do what you want.

No matter what you do, time pushes you to the end. The only thing you can control is the now. This is your life, and it’s ending one minute at a time.

## All Forgotten

History books only record a few major people whose lives can summed up in less than a paragraph. Whole eras are known by just pottery or arrowheads. Everything you ever love, create, or own will be gone, lost, or dead in only a matter of time. Only a few days of your life will be remembered. Every other day in your life will be forgotten along with every single action that you did or didn’t do during it.

## Do It

Just do it. That phrase applies to almost everything. Your potential and possibilities are infinite. You can change the world for better or for worse. You’re not a robot programmed to be a specific way. You can control your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Control and choose what you do and who you are. Be the one who determines the outcome of your life. Do what you have always longed to do. Do everything you ever dreamed of doing.

## Have Confidence

Be brave, courageous, and sure of yourself. Don’t let your fears and worries make your decisions and actions or get in the way of them. In this vast universe, everything you fear is small and insignificant. Don’t panic. Take control over your one and only life. Don’t let your fears hinder you from all you can do.

## Keep Calm

No matter what the situation or circumstance stay the same person, be calm, and be relaxed. Don’t let anything get you down, upset you, make you stressed out, or drive you crazy. Keep yourself well composed at all times. Be open to your surroundings and for anything new. Turn every obstacle into an opportunity. Plan your actions and think before doing them. Have self-control and stability. Choose what you will do and who you will be.

## Love Others

Respect others and their decisions. Care about others’ lives, problems, and struggles. Touch the lives of others positively. Get involved in others’ lives and make them better, because the greatest happiness comes from making others happy. It feels good to make others feel good. The only things that matter in this world are other people and your relationships with them.
