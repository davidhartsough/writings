## Definition

Wika /ˌwiːka/ can be classified as a [pidgin language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin) or a universal auxiliary language / [international auxiliary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language) (IAL) meant for very basic communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language. Wika is not a complete language and is not intended for long sentences or long conversations. Wika is only intended for helping people communicate basic needs — a minimal set of words and phrases essential for exchanges of goods, services, and information.

## Principles

1. Wika only covers the very basics of language and vocabulary.
2. Wika is easy to learn, memorize, teach, read, write, and speak. (Anyone should be able to learn Wika in less than a week.)
3. Wika vocabulary never exceeds more than 60 words.
4. Wika is a phonetic language, where each letter of the alphabet is always pronounced exactly the same in all contexts.
5. Wika only uses the most universally common phonetic sounds. (Anyone should be able to pronounce the phonetics of Wika, as the phonemes are universally shared.)
6. Wika only uses 3 vowels: [a ⟨a⟩ (open/front/unrounded)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_front_unrounded_vowel), [i ⟨i⟩ (close/front/unrounded)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel), and [o ⟨o⟩ (close-mid/back/rounded)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_back_rounded_vowel).
7. Wika only uses 8 consonants: t, k, m, n, b, d, w, y.
8. Wika is written with the ISO Basic Latin alphabet.
9. Wika words are only ever one or two syllables in length.
10. Wika words are based on easily-recognizable patterns of letters (structures).

Also, Wika is often used in conjunction with the basic physical gestures of a complementary one-handed sign language, called Wiko.
