<p><em>You can't be what you can't see.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wonderful quote comes from a book of the same name that explains how powerful and life-changing good exposure to highly aspirational individuals can be. When young people are deciding who they want to be, they look outward to see what is possible. If they never see great, inspiring examples of people accomplishing amazing things, then they will not believe it is possible for themselves and will thus never choose to be that someone who achieves greatly.</p>
<p>In my own life, the wisdom of this quote helps me as I strive to define my identity and explore my potential. Sometimes I can become easily disheartened by what I see around me and worried that my life will never amount to much in the long run. However, what helps me most is to find people I admire for their positive impacts and study their actualizations. When I see that there are others in the world with brilliant visions and aspirations who achieved their goals, I am inspired and motivated to do the same. (Sometimes I purposefully emulate individuals who have achieved goals closely aligned with my own.) Overall, I need to see people in the world having a significant positive impact on the world, so that I can know what is possible and strive to be what I see.</p>
