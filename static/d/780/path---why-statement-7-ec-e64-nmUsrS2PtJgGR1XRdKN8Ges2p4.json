In it he says, \"The WHY is the purpose, cause or belief that drives every one of us.\" The statement is written in the form of two parts: your contribution and your impact. Typically this is written as \"To [contribute] so that [impact].\" This document was the scratch pad of ideas that helped me write my first WHY statement in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"original\"><a href=\"#original\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Original</h2>\n<p>To foster flourishing and its education by helping humanity emphasize thriving and striving for the best.</p>\n<p>To foster flourishing and its education by helping humanity emphasize and actualize thriving and striving for the best.</p>\n<p>To foster a curiosity-driven education of flourishing</p>\n<p>So that humanity would focus on thriving and striving for the best.</p>\n<p>To foster flourishing-focused education</p>\n<p>So that humanity would emphasize thriving and striving for the best.</p>\n<p>To foster flourishing-focused education</p>\n<p>So that humanity would emphasize thriving and striving for the best.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>flourishing</li>\n<li>introspection</li>\n<li>curiosity</li>\n<li>conversation</li>\n<li>creation</li>\n<li>community</li>\n<li>exploration</li>\n<li>sharing laughter</li>\n<li>connections</li>\n<li>discovery</li>\n<li>potential</li>\n<li>identity</li>\n<li>confidence</li>\n<li>perspective</li>\n<li>values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>//</p>\n<ul>\n<li>confidence</li>\n<li>potential</li>\n<li>identity</li>\n<li>perspective</li>\n</ul>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>creating tools and resources focused on fostering flourishing</p>\n<p>through the advocacy and development of</p>\n<p>by cultivating</p>\n<p>curiosity, community, identity, connection, introspection, creation, confidence, and playfulness.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>There's very little meaning to the universe holistically, so, when it comes to your life, you'll have to forge your own.</p>\n<p>To foster flourishing by building communities that cultivate curiosity and advocate education</p>\n<p>so that humanity would define its purpose in</p>\n<p>The drive to thrive and strive for the best.</p>\n<p>Education - curiosity, conversation, collaboration, creation</p>\n<p>To cultivate communities, connections, and collaborations focused on the examination, exploration, and education of flourishing so that humanity would define its purpose in thriving and striving for the best.</p>\n<p>To help humanity understand and achieve flourishing through connection, education, examination, and actualization.</p>\n<p>Flourishing through self-actualization, self-examination, and human connection</p>\n<p>To build deep connections, a firm identity, and a life of purpose.
