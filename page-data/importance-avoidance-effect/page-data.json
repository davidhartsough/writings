(And this is related to the heuristic and bias of the ostrich effect.) So when you think something is important, first of all you have a heuristic of: <em>'Oh, maybe this deserves more attention. Let me spend more time on it later.'</em></p>\n<p>But on the other hand, because it's important, if you don't have a clear idea of what to do and have enough confidence that you'll arrive at a good decision, you're also afraid of it. And that negative emotion pushes it off even more, or you will try to avoid it.</p>\n<p>And so these two coming together makes it that actually emphasizing the importance of improving the attitude or trying to motivate someone even more, sometimes can even backfire — not only that it doesn't work well but not realizing that: oftentimes it's not about motivating people further but it's about getting people to implement their intention successfully.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She effectively explains how we often assume that the solution to a failure to prioritize something is to try to motivate even more by emphasizing the value and importance of that thing.</p>\n<p>There are a few key ideas she touched on that I want to highlight:</p>\n<h2 id=\"conditions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conditions\" aria-label=\"conditions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conditions</h2>\n<h3 id=\"time-focus-attention-and-deep-work\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#time-focus-attention-and-deep-work\" aria-label=\"time focus attention and deep work permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Time, focus, attention, and deep work</h3>\n<p>When we're faced with something perceived as extremely important, we often believe that it deserves more time and attention than we can give to it right now. This leads us to believe that this task or project at hand will require extreme dedication and prioritization. We start to tell ourselves that we will need two times the amount of time we may have projected before. So suddenly the work-time required just doubled and we are hard pressed to find any time in our schedules to give that level of commitment and dedication. (This is also compounded by the belief that extremely important things deserve more perfection. [More on that later.]) In sum, we start to believe that this task or project will need a degree of attention and time that we cannot muster in normal circumstances. As the importance becomes more extreme so do the conditions of engagement. An extremely important project requires extremely perfect circumstances. And in the end, the extreme conditions may never be met, creating a perpetual avoidance and procrastination.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clarity-confidence-and-self-efficacy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#clarity-confidence-and-self-efficacy\" aria-label=\"clarity confidence and self efficacy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Clarity, confidence, and self-efficacy</h3>\n<p>Two of the necessary conditions we need in order to work on something extremely important are: (1) a clear idea and vision of what to do and (2) enough self-efficacy and self-confidence. When both or either of those conditions are not met, we usually feel afraid. And that fear creates a negative emotional response to this extremely important thing, which then further pushes it away. Fortunately, if we can recognize which of these conditions is not met, we can probably work on them, because a lack of clarity or vision and a lack of efficacy or confidence are both problems that are certainly solvable. However, the problem exacerbates when the extremeness of the importance creates an extremeness of these conditions — namely, (1) the extreme complexity of a project can make it feel impossible to gain complete clarity on, and (2) the extreme value of the project can make it feel impossible to have the perfect capabilities to get it right. So the fear might manifest as: (1) \"this is too complicated, confusing, and complex\" or (2) \"this is too difficult to attain\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"strategies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#strategies\" aria-label=\"strategies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Strategies</h2>\n<p>In the end, more motivation is not the solution. Instead, the solution is often about implementation strategies, such as basic behavioral change techniques to prioritize action. Usually the intention is already firmly set, but the mental framing and disposition hinders action and promotes procrastination. So the solution must address both the person's perception and the person's habits and regular routines. Sometimes the simplest solution might just involve effective reminders around a definitive schedule (e.g. setting an alarm to set aside [X] minutes). But personal perception is equally relevant here, so the person must believe that: even a minor moment of intentional dedication is enough and is worthwhile. And changing one's belief can be the trickiest part of the puzzle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"perfection\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#perfection\" aria-label=\"perfection permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Perfection</h2>\n<p>On a final note, I want to reiterate an idea that has been personally troubling for me:</p>\n<p>Usually, when I believe that a project is extremely important, I then also believe that that project must be perfect. Anything less than perfect will be a regretful shame.</p>\n<p>The more important and valuable the project, the more utterly perfect it must be.</p>\n<p>And while striving for perfection often leads to outstanding and extraordinary outcomes, a need for extreme perfection can actually just be paralyzing and create a platform of procrastination. So for me, the ideal is to do whatever is necessary to get started on a project, and that might require a rejection of perfection — I can't be perfect; I can't perform perfectly; and I cannot execute the perfect project. If I expect perfection of myself from the beginning, I may never engage with the project at all. This comes back to the concept of self-efficacy and self-confidence as well; in the frame of perfection, my capabilities will never meet the mark.</p>\n<p>Expectations of perfection can make a project feel unattainable, especially when that project is even moderately complex and consequential. It is sometimes impossible and even detrimental to try to thoroughly analyze and evaluate all possible factors and outcomes of a project. (Trust me, this is coming from a person who puts \"thoroughness\" down as his #1 favorite/greatest strength.) If you must make every consideration and every potential consequence perfect, your project may never see the light of day. It's a nearly impossible task to expect of yourself (or anyone for that matter).</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-can-we-do\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-what-can-we-do\" aria-label=\"so what can we do permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So what can we do?</h2>\n<p>Well, first off, there are many things we can <em>stop</em> doing…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop trying to be perfect all the time.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to make a task or project perfect.</li>\n<li>Stop believing that everything we do is <em>extremely</em> important.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to prove ourselves as perfect and super outstanding.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to be the absolute best.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to make a task or project the absolute best.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to avoid feedback, exposure, and critique until the project is perfectly ready.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to perfectly prepare and plan every detail in advance (without ever taking any action).</li>\n<li>Stop trying to think too long-term with your project's roadmap, months and years in the future, when you don't have the next days and weeks outlined.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to make visionary ambitions that exaggerate the project's importance.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to constantly escalate the project's potential value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But then I think the next best thing we can <em>start</em> to do is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are socially motivated, aim to live, act, and behave as if your close loved ones were your only \"audience\" in life.\n<ul>\n<li>Aim to please them and not the entire world.</li>\n<li>Aim to just be perfect in their eyes, not everyone else in the world.</li>\n<li>Aim to be the best within that smaller, more reasonable context and only in specialized areas of your own expertise.</li>\n<li>Only aim to prove yourself to these few.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you are motivated by potential consequential social impact, start with the aspirations of positively impacting just your close loved ones at first.\n<ul>\n<li>Narrow the scale and scope of your projects' and life's impact on these few, initially (in order to limit your vision and expected outcomes).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Find ways to reduce the complexity of your project.\n<ul>\n<li>Break your next steps down into bite-sized, manageable tasks that might only take up an hour or two of your time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you're trying to work on a project that seemingly requires a great deal of time, then set a low bar expectation on yourself to just schedule a small amount of time on your project(s) in a recurring timeframe.

One of the biggest and most rewarding challenges in life is unraveling the mysteries of your own motivation. (What makes you come alive? What stresses you out? What makes you eager and excited? What makes you feel burnt out?)</p>\n<p>Tailor the insights you might gain from this \"importance-avoidance effect\" to your own understanding of your motivation. (What might be quite motivating for some people could be demotivating for others.
