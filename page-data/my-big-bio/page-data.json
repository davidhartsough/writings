Back then I had a website running called My Big Bio (at <a href=\"http://www.mybig.bio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.mybig.bio</a>). You could create an autobiography with it by simply answering a series of questions grouped by sections. The following are my answers to the questions from the Perspective and Purpose sections of my autobiography.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"perspective\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#perspective\" aria-label=\"perspective permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Perspective</h2>\n<p><strong>What's most important?</strong></p>\n<p>Flourishing through self-actualization, self-examination, and human connection</p>\n<p><strong>How do you make the most of life?</strong></p>\n<p>By developing my connections, my identity, and my potential, and by making the world a better, happier place</p>\n<p><strong>What is the best experience a person can have?</strong></p>\n<p>Self-actualization and achievement</p>\n<p><strong>What does the world need?</strong></p>\n<p>To define and understand human flourishing, and to cultivate reflection, collaboration, and empathy</p>\n<p><strong>What makes you most happy?</strong></p>\n<p>Having meaningful discussions, sharing laughter, and helping others flourish</p>\n<p><strong>What do you fear most?</strong></p>\n<p>Failing to self-actualize and make meaningful, positive contributions toward humanity's flourishing</p>\n<p><strong>What are you most grateful for?</strong></p>\n<p>The human connections I have made, the support I have been given, and my insatiable calling to make the world a better, happier place</p>\n<p><strong>If you could send one message to the world, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p>Be confident.
