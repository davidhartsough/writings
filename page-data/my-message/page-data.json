I tried to identify which core truths were at the root of all essential wisdom. I tried narrowing down my large list of \"statements that somewhat summarize my ideals\" into a cohesive message that would be my main motto: \"My Message\".</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this is strikingly similar to the motivational message I had written five years prior: <a href=\"https://davidhartsough.com/writings/short-life-small-planet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">A Short Life On A Small Planet</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-message\"><a href=\"#what-is-the-message\" aria-label=\"what is the message permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is the message?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Everything will be okay</li>\n<li>Reflect/evaluate/examine</li>\n<li>Be mindful/aware</li>\n<li>Have drive</li>\n<li>Take risks</li>\n<li>Realize your full potential</li>\n<li>You have the potential for greatness; don't settle</li>\n<li>Life is short</li>\n<li>Let go</li>\n<li>The only thing you can control is the now</li>\n<li>You can only change yourself</li>\n<li>Love and accept yourself then others</li>\n<li>Be confident/courageous, be calm</li>\n<li>Share laughter, share love</li>\n<li>Focus</li>\n<li>Engage</li>\n<li>Connect</li>\n<li>People and your relationships, connections and interactions with them are most important</li>\n<li>Fill your life with meaning</li>\n<li>Achieve/accomplish individual goals/aims/objectives</li>\n<li>Don't fear or worry</li>\n<li>Love conquers all</li>\n<li>Be passionate</li>\n<li>In time, things change</li>\n<li>Perspective shapes reality</li>\n<li>Don't take life too seriously</li>\n<li>Learn</li>\n<li>Experience</li>\n<li>Be open and honest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If approached/handled correctly, our greatest sufferings/hardships can be the most useful, meaningful, influential and beneficial experience in life.

What is your perspective on this life?</p>\n<p>I invite you now to come and see the world in a new way. Take on a new perspective. Take on a new reality.</p>\n<p>Start with the big picture:</p>\n<p>Everything that we can observe, exists in the universe. Using the current technology on Earth, humans can observe 46.5 billion light-years in every direction into space. So far, humans have found that Earth is one planet of eight in a solar system of many billion in a galaxy of 80 billion in their observable sphere of the universe.</p>\n<p>On Earth there are 7 billion humans. You make up 0.0000000145% of the Earth's population. The current life expectancy for humans in \"well-developed\" countries is about 75 years of age. In these countries, the average individuals mature around the age of 15 and sleeps an approximate average of 8 hours per day. This leaves one with only 350,400 hours mature, awake and alive. Life is short.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don't fear or worry</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Don't take life too seriously</strong></li>\n<li><strong>In time, things change</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Everything will be okay</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The only thing you can control is the now</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You can only change yourself</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Focus</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Realize your full potential</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You have the potential for greatness</strong>; don't settle</li>\n<li><strong>Have drive</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Find what engages you</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Achieve</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Take risks</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Experience is the best teacher (and suffering even better stillâ€¦ [below])</p>\n<p>If approached/handled correctly, our greatest <strong>sufferings/hardships</strong> can be the most useful, meaningful, influential and beneficial experience in life.
