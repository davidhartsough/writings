Instead, it points to an alternative approach: a \"negative path\" to happiness that entails taking a radically different stance towards those things that most of us spend our lives trying hard to avoid.</p>\n<p>It involves learning to enjoy uncertainty, embracing insecurity, stopping trying to think positively, becoming familiar with failure, and even learning to value death.</p>\n<p>In short, in order to be truly happy, we might actually need to be willing to experience more negative emotions — or, at the very least, to learn to stop running quite so hard from them.</p>\n<p>Which is a bewildering thought, and one that calls into question not just our methods for achieving happiness, but also our assumptions about what happiness really means.</p>\n<h4 id=\"history\"

emphasized the benefits of always contemplating how badly things might go.</p>\n<p>It lies deep near the core of Buddhism, which counsels that true security lies in the unrestrained embrace of insecurity — in the recognition that we never really stand on solid ground and never can.</p>\n<p>It underpins the medieval tradition of \"memento mori\", which celebrates the life-giving benefits of never forgetting about death.</p>\n<p>And it's what connects new age writers with more mainstream recent work in cognitive psychology on the self-defeating nature of positive thinking.</p>\n<h4

echoing Aldous Huxley, labeled \"the law of reversed effort\" or \"the backwards law\".</p>\n<p>It's the notion that: in all sorts of contexts, from our personal lives to politics, all this \"trying to make everything right\" is a big part of what's wrong.</p>\n<p>Or, to quote Watts: \"When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink, but when you try to sink, you float.\" And that: \"Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure.\"</p>\n<p>\"In many cases,\" wrote Huxley, \"the harder we try with the conscious will to do something, the less we shall succeed.\"</p>\n<h4

the happiness that arises <em>through</em> negativity, rather than trying to drown negativity out with relentless good cheer.</p>\n<p>If a fixation on positivity is the disease, this approach is the

or a situation truly \"negative\" if it ultimately leads to happiness?</li>\n<li>If \"being positive\" doesn't make you happy, is it right to call it \"being positive\" at all?</li>\n<li>If you redefine happiness to accommodate negativity, is it still happiness?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>None of these questions can be tidily resolved.</p>\n<p>This is partly because the proponents of the negative path share only a general way of seeing life, rather than a single strict set of beliefs.</p>\n<p>But it's also because one crucial foundation of their approach is precisely that happiness involves paradoxes — that there is no way to tie up all the loose ends, however desperately we might want to.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stoicism-and-buddhism\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a
