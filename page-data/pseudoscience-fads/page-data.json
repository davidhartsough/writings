It's amazing to see that I can grow and adapt (and that I'm not a fixed, static, invariable, programmed robot). Personality tests give me a brief (and modestly imprecise) snapshot of that temporary version of myself at that time. And by comparing changes across those snapshots I can see a glimpse of my personal evolution (although a biased view, at that).</p>\n<p>However, as this video eloquent explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Personality is <strong>not</strong> a stable, measurable feature of an individual.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And most importantly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The strict divisions between personality types don't reflect <strong>real-life nuances</strong>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So beyond these snapshots, I've needed to learn the hard lesson that: While these categorizations and \"types\" are fun, intriguing, and a great go-to social ice breaker conversation for almost everyone, ... <strong>They are fundamentally inaccurate, flawed, biased, and most definitely <em>not</em> a solid foundation for decision-making or for assuming that we fully understand someone.</strong> (And this applies in its own ways to the pseudoscience of astrology.) As always, our best attempts to understand human nature require <strong>nuanced thinking</strong> and <strong>multi-factor thinking</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"note\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#note\" aria-label=\"note permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Note</h3>\n<p><strong>Why are you writing this, David?</strong></p>\n<p>As a clarifying note of context: I'm not trying to start a dispute with all my friends who are into personality tests and astrology.

The dangers of subscribing to pseudoscience are numerous, but my biggest fear is that people will go their entire lives with a fundamental misunderstanding about the basic nature of humans, the universe, and science.</p>\n<p>I'm concerned about the popularity of these pseudoscience beliefs, because it reflects a widespread and commonplace lack of rational, logical, scientific reasoning, critical thinking, and skepticism. And without a solid foundation of science, critical thinking, logic, and rationality, people will fail to reason effectively with their decision making and will firmly believe with conviction in misconceptions as truth. With such significant misunderstandings underlying the basis of people's thinking, biases and misconceptions thrive, while empirical evidence, scientific research, and proven knowledge are ignored and neglected.</p>\n<p>At our very worst, human history has shown that widespread pseudo-scientific misconceptions, superstitions, misunderstandings, and unfounded/baseless spiritual beliefs have been harmful and lead to problems such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>rejection of proven disease/disorder treatments in favor of pseudo-scientific treatments and medicines, resulting in people forgoing important medical treatment, which leads to avoidable and preventable illness and death</li>\n<li>rejection of rationality, logic, reason, science, and empirical evidence</li>\n<li>forming classifications of people that lead to stereotyping, discrimination, judgement, racism, and even genocide</li>\n<li>forming cults and religious groups that prey upon the beliefs and convictions of people to take advantage of them and to breed extremism</li>\n<li>denial of important topics, issues, and ideas that proven with empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and scientific research</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My hope is that we can undo and outdo these harmful beliefs and misconceptions by instead building upon our collective knowledge and using a rational, logical scientific method of approach to research, reasoning, and acquiring knowledge in order to lead humanity towards progress. Here's my hope for what we can do to replace each of these harmful potential consequences of pseudoscience:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I hope we can continually replace pseudo-scientific healthcare, medicine, and therapy with legitimate, scientific healthcare, medicine, and therapy, so that humanity might continue to eradicate diseases and illnesses, prevent and treat suffering and sickness, and provide effective care and treatment for diseases, disorders, and illnesses.</li>\n<li>I hope we can replace people's tendencies to reject science with an excitement for and celebration of the sciences.</li>\n<li>I hope that we replace divisive classifications and stereotypes with celebrations of the complexity and nuance of humanity and human nature and the development of sciences that break down these divisions in classifications or types to instead unite people, rather than polarize them.</li>\n<li>I hope that we can reduce the likelihood of cults and extremist religious groups by disproving and eliminating baseless spiritual beliefs, unfounded superstitions, and pseudo-scientific misconceptions that drive dogmatic convictions behind such extremism.</li>\n<li>I hope that we can provide such convincing evidence of our most important topics, issues, and ideas that no one can deny their reality and their priority.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"what-instead-no-mo-pseudo\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-instead-no-mo-pseudo\" aria-label=\"what instead no mo pseudo permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What instead? No mo' \"pseudo\"</h2>\n<p>Why does anyone care about getting involved and invested in these self-discovery pseudoscience fads?</p>\n<p>My general suspicion is that people want self-knowledge and a deeper understanding of themselves and others.</p>\n<p>So if you're searching for a better understanding of yourself, your behavior, your tendencies, your typical mindset, or your identity, then why not seek out the science of biology, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology? The best answers any human has to any questions of human nature come from these fields of study.</p>\n<p>If you want to know why you do what you do, what causes those behaviors and thoughts, and what motivates and influences you, then seek out answers from accepted, proven science that is falsifiable, tested, and validated by skeptical criticism from experts and intellectuals. This will get you closer to \"true\" knowledge and understanding about yourself and others. Understanding human nature is a matter of science, not New Age spiritual speculation. Just because an idea is trending and popular, doesn't mean that it is valid, verified, accepted, scientific, or factual. Much of \"pop\" science is actually pseudoscience, and if we don't have the scientific literacy to catch these deceptions, we will be duped and susceptible to a host of misconceptions and false beliefs. The simplicity of broad, easy-to-remember classifications from personality types to astrological star signs is what makes them most appealing and popular, spreading like wildfire across social circles and conversations. But ironically, the very reason things like Enneagrams, Myers-Briggs, and astrology blow up and become popular fads is the exact same reason why these things are not scientific: they are extremely reductionary and awfully simplistic classifications.</p>\n<p>You are much, much more complex than what any sign, horoscope, or \"type\" classification would dare to explain. Your behaviors and mind are the results of complicated, intricate systems with multiple nuanced factors. We will never get very far if we assume that we can classify all behaviors as the outcomes of a single personality type, a star sign, a hormone, a genetic disposition, a brain region, or a childhood experience. Instead, we know that every bit of behavior has multiple levels of causality. To explain all of an individual's behavior with a simple classification is a hugely reductionary oversimplification that doesn't take into account the multitude of contextual factors that impact each person every second. There are influences on your behavior traceable from milliseconds before the action in your neural network and nervous system, to moments before in your environment, to days before in your body's regulatory systems, to months before in your brain's neural plasticity, to years before in your life experiences shaping your memories and frontal cortex, to a lifetime before in your genes and fetal life, to generations before in your cultural history, to species before in your evolution, etc, etc, etc. (That long sentence is just the tip of the iceberg, barely scratching the surface of the complexity of behavior causality.) If you want to understand behavior, you have to take into account what happened a millisecond before to a million years before, with everything in between.</p>\n<p>If you want a better, bigger picture of just how nuanced and multi-factored human behavior is, read the first few chapters (and the final closing thoughts) of the book <em>Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst</em> by Robert Sapolsky.

As you've heard a hundred times before since Socrates: \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" And that line of reasoning is probably what drove most people to seek out examining life through the lenses of popular self-discovery fads, such as astrology and personality typing. I love that my generation is filled with the desire of self-examination and self-discovery. However, I feel devastated by the popular spreading of pseudoscience sapping that potential and diverting the enthusiastic attention of millions of people away from <em>truly effective means of self-examination</em> and self-discovery. The labels, classifications, and types of personality tests and astrology give people a false sense of some satisfactory understanding and deceptively appeases that desire for self-knowledge. Millions of people in my generation buy into the belief that their star sign and personality type give them a holistic understanding into themselves and a complete self-concept. They are ignoring and missing the bigger picture while fixated on a tiny piece of the bigger puzzle (or what might actually be a false claim, void of truth, answers, and value).</p>\n<p>I want to promote a more effective way of reflection/introspection, seeking understanding, examining the self, forging an identity, and building a self-concept:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Ask the right questions</em> about yourself and your values, tendencies, habits, perspectives, beliefs, concepts, emotions, relationships, roles, groups, experiences, memories, history, strengths, weaknesses, interests, flaws, aspirations, traits, desires, ideologies, and all of the many aspects of the \"self\", and <em>write down answers</em>.</li>\n<li>Ask people who you have a good, trusting, respectful, positive, and close relationship with to help you answer those same questions to work past your biases and blindspots and get a more accurate depiction and representation of your actual self.</li>\n<li>Explore and examine the answers you've gathered to <em>analyze yourself</em>, find patterns, and infer general conclusions using inductive reasoning. (Ask the same people for help with this as well.)</li>\n<li><em>Research and study the science</em> behind the aspects of yourself you've discovered <em>to better understand the nature of your nature</em>! (This is one of the most rewarding, insightful, and exciting experiences I have ever had. I cannot recommend this enough!)</li>\n<li>Seek out opportunities to handle your uniquenesses of self or even change aspects of yourself according to what you learn from your research. Self-development and self-improvement is the next logical step for any self-examination practice. Turn your newfound knowledge into <em>practical wisdom</em> by applying it to your life.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"tools\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tools\" aria-label=\"tools permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tools</h3>\n<p>There are some incredible tools for aiding in this long (but very worthwhile) process of introspection.
