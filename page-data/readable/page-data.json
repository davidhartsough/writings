Make sure they are real people that you know well enough to imagine their responses. Picture them reading and reacting to your post, sentence by sentence. (Revise as you go.)</li>\n<li>Once you've finished your first draft, imagine watching 2 of your favorite authors read your post and react to it. Imagine sending an email to the most esteemed writer you know and asking them for feedback. Predict their reply. (Go back and rewrite again.)</li>\n<li>Finally, once you've gone through a few drafts and feel like you've got it, ask at least 2 diverse people to read it and give you feedback.
