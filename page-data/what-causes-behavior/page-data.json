What caused this behavior?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A high-level overview on <strong>how behavior happens</strong> / <strong>why a behavior occurs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The action of neurons in the brain (neural activity) — in the preceding second before.</li>\n<li>The thoughts, memories, emotions, and sensory stimuli of the environment that activated those neurons — in the seconds to minutes before.</li>\n<li>The hormones in circulation that shaped those thoughts, memories, and emotions and altered how sensitive the brain was to particular environmental stimuli — in the hours to days before.</li>\n<li>The experiences and environment that changed how those neurons function, causing some to sprout new connections and become more excitable, and causing the opposite in others (neural plasticity) — in the weeks to years before.</li>\n<li>The socialization, acculturation, experiences, and environment that shaped the construction of the frontal cortex — in the years of adolescence before.</li>\n<li>The experiences and epigenetic changes that shaped the fundamental construction of the brain — in the years of childhood before.</li>\n<li>The fetal environment — in the years in the womb.</li>\n<li>The inherited genes and gene-environment interactions.</li>\n<li>The culture and socioeconomic status that influenced childhood experiences and family upbringing.</li>\n<li>The culture and cultural values of ancestors — in the centuries before.</li>\n<li>The ecological factors that influenced the culture — in the centuries before.</li>\n<li>The evolutionary pressures that molded the human species and its genes — in the one hundred million years before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In sum:</p>\n<p>Q: \"Why did that behavior occur?\"</p>\n<p>A: Because of the events from: one second before, one minute, one hour, one day, one week, one month, one year, one decade, one century, to one hundred million years before.</p>\n<p>Key factors include: neurons, neural activity, thoughts, memories, emotions, sensory stimuli, neurochemicals, hormones, experiences, environment, socialization, acculturation, the nervous system, the brain, each brain system, the construction of each brain region (including the frontal cortex), neural plasticity, epigenetics, gene-environment interactions, childhood experiences, family upbringing, family socioeconomic status, the prenatal/fetal environment, inherited genes, societal values, ancestral culture, ecology, evolution, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Basically, what we're seeing here is, if you want to understand a behavior — whether it's an appalling one, a wondrous one, or confusedly in between — if you want to understand that, you've got take into account what happened a second before to a million years before, everything in between.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It's caused by what happened a millisecond before to a million years before, and everything in between.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"So what can we conclude at this point? Officially, it's complicated. Wow, that's really helpful. It's complicated, and you'd better be real careful, real cautious before you conclude you know what causes a behavior, especially if it's a behavior you're judging harshly.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It's complicated.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Our worst behaviors — ones we condemn and punish — are the products of our biology.
