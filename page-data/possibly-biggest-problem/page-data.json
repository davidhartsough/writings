And my initial response is always, \"Oh yeah! Let's do that. I'll do that.\" And then when I don't do that thing, I'm seen as unreliable, untrustworthy, and lacking integrity. I fail to \"keep my word\" because my quick, inconsiderate agreement to everything is a promise I genuinely want to keep but rarely ever do. (Obviously, I want to be a good friend who is reliable, trustworthy, and full of integrity.)</p>\n<p>And then with myself, I feel like I'm constantly looking back at the past day, past week, and past month with nothing but frustration at myself for not doing everything I wanted to do. So I'm beating myself up about failing to achieve my own goals on the timelines I expected.</p>\n<p>I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I have pretty unrealistic (and thus pretty unhealthy) expectations of what I think I can do with the time that I have. I tend to overestimate what I am capable of doing and the amount of time I actually have to dedicate towards the things I want to prioritize. In the end, I've wound up with a ton of \"want to do\" items in a giant list that seems to grow more often than it shrinks.</p>\n<p>Altogether I'm stressed about time, prioritization, and the fear of that endless, bottomless, ever-growing pile of things I want to do. This stress is a symptom of some significant problem that I currently don't know how to resolve. I want to correctly frame this problem to accurately diagnose it. What are the origins of this problem?</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-it-feel\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-does-it-feel\" aria-label=\"how does it feel permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How does it <em>feel</em>?</h3>\n<p>Here are different ways of describing the feeling of the problem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I feel as though <em>I cannot find enough time</em> for everything I want to focus on in life.</li>\n<li>I feel as though <em>I cannot schedule a routine that provides me enough time</em> for everything I want to focus on in life.</li>\n<li>I feel as though <em>I cannot perfectly prioritize my time</em> for everything I want to focus on in life.</li>\n<li>I feel as though <em>I cannot muster the mental and physical energy to both prioritize and accomplish</em> everything I want to focus on in life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"is-it-really-a-big-deal\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#is-it-really-a-big-deal\" aria-label=\"is it really a big deal permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Is it really a big deal?</h3>\n<p>To demonstrate how real and significant this problem is, I sat down to write out a list of everything that I wanted to do in the past month, and <strong>without pause, I wrote out 56 different things</strong>… 56 things I didn't do last month, no matter how badly I wanted to do them. (I believe I could further add to this list, but after writing out 56 things nearly continuously for a few minutes, I was honestly overwhelmed just by the expanse of the words on the page alone. I don't want to write any more because I feel visceral aversion when I go to do it. It's a bit anxiety-driving.)</p>\n<p>Outside that list I only did about 6 major things to completion (meaning that I had a list of 62 things at the beginning of last month), and I only made major contributions to the progress of about 2 things of those 56.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-actually-happened\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-actually-happened\" aria-label=\"what actually happened permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What actually happened?</h3>\n<p>Besides the time spent doing those 6 major achievements and contributing to the progress of 2 other things, what did I do with all the time in the month?</p>\n<p>Sadly, I don't actually have a solid, comprehensive answer to this question. In a nutshell, here is my best guess: I fulfilled my basic needs (slept, ate, took care of my hygiene), cleaned, worked, used my phone/computer (or more specifically, the internet), I talked with people, I \"hung out\" with people, I read, watched, and listened to all sorts of things, I wrote, and maybe I even did a few things with music too.</p>\n<p>Only a few of those things fall into my list of things I wanted to do or felt I needed to do. The rest is just \"life\", I guess. Or it's just <em>my</em> life and maybe I should be able to remove some of those things and replace them with the things on my to-do list. Who knows.
