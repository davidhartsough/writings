And for me, \"notable\" means three general scenarios: (1) any time I do something interesting besides typical daily routines, (2) any time I go somewhere interesting outside the house, or (3) any time I hang out with people that I don't live with already (my roommates).</p>\n<p>Regularly using Moments gives you a lot of information, but I wanted to see what valuable ideas would come from all this information. So I've taken time to analyze everything and draw some conclusions.</p>\n<p>I have learned a lot of interesting facts about myself, my habits, and my life that give me insightful takeaways and nuggets of wisdom. Here are some of the facts and my respective conclusions I've made, broken down into the core categories of the Moments app.</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgment</strong>: There are two things worth noting with this information.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The pandemic caused a lockdown and quarantine that caused significant changes in opportunities for typical social interactions.</li>\n<li>I was pretty diligent about using it and recording my moments, but there was one important month this year that I missed more than half of, which is super sad because it was a jam-packed month full of amazing memories.</li>\n<li>(Oh well. I think this information is still mostly accurate.)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"people\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#people\" aria-label=\"people permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>People</h2>\n<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Of the people I don't live with (roommates), I have some friends I have hung out with close to a hundred times, and some friends 40-60 times.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of amazing people that I know are great friends but have only recorded hanging out with them less than 10-15 times.</li>\n<li>I have around a dozen really close friends that I regularly hang out with, usually at least once a week or every other week.</li>\n<li>Besides these dozen or so close friends, there are these other amazing people I consider good friends yet might only actually ever hang out with about once a month.</li>\n<li>Besides roommates, I spend time with friends close to 50% of the year (which is basically every other day).</li>\n<li>I see my roommates almost every day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm extremely grateful and thankful for my friends.

Half of my lifetime is spent with friends. (Or basically all of my time if you count roommates as well, who are definitely my friends.)</li>\n<li><strong>Dinner</strong>: The most common activity that I do when spending time with friends is eating dinner together. Dinner is an important bonding experience to share with friends, and it's generally always paired with great conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>Games</strong>: Playing games with friends is one of the best bonding experiences one could ask for and is the second most common activity that I do when spending time with friends (#1 is \"dinner\"). About half the time I spend with friends is spent playing games.</li>\n<li><strong>Talking</strong>: While talking is just something that happens all the time during virtually every other activity I do with friends, I often spend time doing solely just that with friends. Because this is something I did not do a great job recording accurately, it's hard to truly estimate how often this happens and how many times a year or month or week. But if I gave my best guess, I'd say I have those extra special, outstanding conversations about twice a week. Conversation is a big part of who I am, what I love, and how I love.</li>\n<li><strong>Altogether</strong>: The best evenings spent hanging out with friends involve all of these things: dinner, discussion, and games.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"big-conclusions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#big-conclusions\" aria-label=\"big conclusions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Big Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Overall, when looking at the most notable yet most common moments in my life, here's how I spend most of my time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With <strong>friends</strong></li>\n<li>In a <strong>home</strong> (mine or a friends')</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hanging out</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eating <strong>dinner</strong></li>\n<li>Having <strong>conversations</strong></li>\n<li>Playing <strong>games</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Friends.
