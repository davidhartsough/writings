When young people are deciding who they want to be, they look outward to see what is possible. If they never see great, inspiring examples of people accomplishing amazing things, then they will not believe it is possible for themselves and will thus never choose to be that someone who achieves greatly.</p>\n<p>In my own life, the wisdom of this quote helps me as I strive to define my identity and explore my potential. Sometimes I can become easily disheartened by what I see around me and worried that my life will never amount to much in the long run. However, what helps me most is to find people I admire for their positive impacts and study their actualizations. When I see that there are others in the world with brilliant visions and aspirations who achieved their goals, I am inspired and motivated to do the same. (Sometimes I purposefully emulate individuals who have achieved goals closely aligned with my own.) Overall, I need to see people in the world having a significant positive impact on the world, so that I can know what is possible and strive to be what I see.</p>\n<h2 id=\"50-people-and-their-impacts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#50-people-and-their-impacts\" aria-label=\"50 people and their impacts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>50 people and their impacts</h2>\n<p>(This list is in no particular order at all.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Nicola Sturgeon - politician</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Established the Wellbeing Economy Governments</li>\n<li>Political and socio-economic ideas / changes</li>\n<li>Helped millions of people see the need for a nation's government to cultivate an economy that prioritizes well-being and see the benefits and successes of nations that embrace this socio-politico-economic ideology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>George Monbiot - journalist, environmental/political activist, author</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vision for society built around our capacity for altruism and cooperation</li>\n<li>environmental and political activism / writing</li>\n<li>Helped millions of people rally behind the vision for a society built around the human capacity for altruism and cooperation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kate Raworth - economist, university, professor, researcher, author</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sustainable, universally beneficial economy</li>\n<li>economic model that balances essential human needs and planetary boundaries</li>\n<li>Helped millions of people understand the problematic nature of capitalist economic systems in light of the unsustainability of infinite growth and realize the need for a sustainable, universally beneficial economic model that balances essential human needs and planetary boundaries.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Andrew Yang - entrepreneur, nonprofit founder</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A vision for Universal Basic Income</li>\n<li>economic policy</li>\n<li>Reform capitalism and change its value system</li>\n<li>federal government reorganize the economy</li>\n<li>capitalist economy that’s geared toward maximizing human well-being and fulfillment</li>\n<li>\n<p>Human capitalism would have a few core tenets:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Humanity is more important than money.</li>\n<li>The unit of an economy is each person, not each dollar.</li>\n<li>Markets exist to serve our common goals and values.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Helped millions of people conceptualize and envision universal basic income and an effective reformation of capitalism that values humanity and its common goals and values above all else and maximizes human well-being and fulfillment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Martin E.P.
